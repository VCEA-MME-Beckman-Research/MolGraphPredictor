# MolGraphPredictor

This project uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict molecular properties.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git

### Installation

**For macOS and Linux:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MolGraphPredictor.git
cd MolGraphPredictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For Windows:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MolGraphPredictor.git
cd MolGraphPredictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model, run:

```bash
python MolecularGNN.py
```

This will train the model and save the trained model to the `model` directory.

## Data

The `molecule_graphs` directory is used to store molecule graph data.

## Model

The `model` directory is used to store trained models.
